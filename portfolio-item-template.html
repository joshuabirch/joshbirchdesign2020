                <p class="body-text">Hello! I'm Josh, a UX designer from Birmingham, England. I currently study Computing Science at Staffordshire University and have developed a serious passion for UX design throughout my degree. While I have predominantly designed for web based products, I have serious aspirations to design in video games which resonates through my disseration which is titled "The Research and Development of Functional Immersive UI in Video Games". My design process is a little unorthodox as I am still new to the industry, however I am a huge fan of aesthetic design while also taking massive pride in responsive design.

                <p class="body-text">Well, what else can I say about myself? I enjoy long walks on the beach? I guess I like playing a lot of video games in my spare time, definitely for primary research only... I'm massively into Rainbow Six Siege, Final Fantasy XIV and FIFA 20 currently however I do plan to finally play The Witcher 3 at some point, it's just such a long game y'know? Speaking of FIFA 20, I love my football! I torture myself every week supporting Aston Villa and have reluctantly held a season ticket since 2014.</p>
