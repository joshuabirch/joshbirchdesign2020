                <p class="body-text">Hello! I'm Josh, a UX designer from Birmingham, England. I currently study Computing Science at Staffordshire University and have developed a serious passion for UX design throughout my degree. While I have predominantly designed for web based products, I have serious aspirations to design in video games which resonates through my disseration which is titled "The Research and Development of Functional Immersive UI in Video Games". My design process is a little unorthodox as I am still new to the industry, however I am a huge fan of aesthetic design while also taking massive pride in responsive design. Take a look at my portfolio and get in touch!</p>

                <p class="body-text">Well, what else can I say about myself? I enjoy long walks on the beach? I guess I like playing a lot of video games in my spare time, definitely for primary research only... I'm massively into Rainbow Six Siege, Final Fantasy XIV and FIFA 20 currently however I do plan to finally play The Witcher 3 at some point, it's just such a long game y'know? Speaking of FIFA 20, I love my football! I torture myself every week supporting Aston Villa and have reluctantly held a season ticket since 2014.</p>

                <p class="body-text">I have had quite the journey. I came out of High School into Sixth Form with a real burning passion to teach in Computer Science, so I took Computer Science (obviously), Product Design and Media Studies as my A-Level options. Sixth Form was the first point in my life where I had to make a really big decision. Basically, the school was undergoing some major changes and the teaching wasn't exactly perfect. So, after a year of Sixth Form I decided to leave to try and keep the personal goal of making it to university a dream. I would be the first person in my entire family to do so, you can imagine the determination.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="body-text">I then moved to South Staffs College to study Level 3 Computing (basically an A-Level) where I met some wonderful people who put me back on track with my studies and, more importantly, believed in me. I gained new skills in animation, social media management, C# development, Visual Basic development while also researching cyber security and computer hardware. I came out with a distinction in my foundation diploma and received a fantastic opportunity...</p>
                <br>
                <p class="body-text">Because South Staffs College worked in conjunction with Staffordshire University on a small selection of courses, I was able to combine my AS levels and my foundation diploma to apply for a HND (Higher National Diploma) in Computing Science! I took it with both hands and made the jump immediately instead of completing my level 3 qualification to an extended diploma.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="body-text">It was here where I found my passion for UX design, designing and developing websites for a number of modules which rapidly improved my design and development ability. I also studied CISCO networking, data analysis, employment development, C# development while also completing a 'mini' dissertation, which was an iOS augmented reality application for undergraduate computer science students.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="body-text">This qualification was in preparation for a 'top-up' year in which converts your HND into a BSc(Hons) in Computing Science. Let's just call it my third year of my degree, it sounds more mainstream! I'm coming towards the end of my undergraduate studies now and looking back on the past 5 years, I have come a long way in terms of personal development but also in terms of my skills while also finding an area of the industry that I am really passionate about today, just remember I wanted to be a teacher originally! I have created more web products this year along with SQL development, data analytics, project management, academic research papers and my dissertation which is currently in its research stage.</p>
